<!--what this website is about-->
<p>I am passionate about the environment because it is one of our responsibilities as humans to take care of our home. I believe that all animals should be treated equally with respect and shouldnâ€™t have to be killed. Animals are crucial to our environment and system of life. If animals continue to go extinct, it will disrupt our ecosystem and negatively affect humans as well.</p>
<p> Main Idea: I want people all over the world to understand the importance of saving endangered species and how they can solve this serious problem.</p>
