   <h2> What Can You Change About Your Life to Help </h2> 
   <p> There are many ways that you can help protect endangered animals. You can start to lead a sustainable lifestyle where you recycle, compost, support sustainable brands, go vegetarian/vegan, conserve eneregy, and use renewable energy. All of these habits improve the environment and reduce the amount of pollution/waste produced. All of this protects animal habitats and saves lives.
